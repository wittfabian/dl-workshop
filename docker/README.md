# Installation via Docker

We're building this container on top of [Debian 8 Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/debian/) and [Anaconda Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3/).

## Installation of Docker Daemon
Download and install the Docker Daemon from the [Docker Website](https://www.docker.com/) for your OS.

### Proxy Configuration in the Docker Daemon
Docker will download all the necessary files for the build process from the internet so it might be necessary to configure a proxy. You can switch to a manual proxy configuration in the Docker Daemon Settings under Proxies.

## Build Docker Container locally
Now you need to build the docker container. Navigate in the terminal into the repository directory and then into the docker directory ```dl-workshop/docker```.

### Proxy Configuration in the Dockerfile
In case you need a proxy and you have set it correctly in the Docker Daemon, you need to set it in the Docker file as well. Uncomment the four corresponding lines under the both ```# for proxy usage``` headlines (on the top and bottom of the file) and add your proxy address in the first two lines. The last two lines remain empty so there is no need for a change.

### Execute the Build Command
Now execute in the ```dl-workshop/docker``` directory the following command.

```sh
docker build . -f Dockerfile -t dl_workshop_container
```

### Run Docker Container
After the build process was successfully done you can run the container.

```sh
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -d -v <absolute/path/to>/dl-workshop/notebooks:/notebooks dl_workshop_container
```

## Use Image from DockerHub
```sh
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -d -v <absolute/path/to>/dl-workshop/notebooks:/notebooks wittfabian/dl-workshop
```

We're using the following parameters:
- ```-p 8888:8888``` to export Jupyter Web interface
- ```-p 6006:6006``` to export Tensorboard Web interface
- ```-d``` to run Docker container in background
- ```-v notebooks:/notebooks``` to mount *notebooks* folder inside Docker container

## Accessing and Running the Notebooks
The notebooks are now available in your browser under the following url:

```sh
http://localhost:8888
```
