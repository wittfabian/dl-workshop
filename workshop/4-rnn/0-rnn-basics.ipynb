    "Why the hidden layer? Well, we could technically do this. \n",

    "\n",
    "However, we'd be missing out. I encourage you to sit and consider the difference between these two information flows. For a little helpful hint, consider how this plays out. \n",

    "Focus on the last hidden layer (4th line). In the hidden layer recurrence, we see a presence of every input seen so far. In the input layer recurrence, it's exclusively defined by the current and previous inputs. This is why we model hidden recurrence. Hidden recurrence learns what to remember whereas input recurrence is hard wired to just remember the immediately previous datapoint. \n",

    "Let's say we were trying to predict the next word in a song given the previous. The \"input layer recurrence\" would break down if the song accidentally had the same sequence of two words in multiple places. Think about it, if the song had the statements \"I love you\", and \"I love carrots\", and the network was trying to predict the next word, how would it know what follows \"I love\"? It could be carrots. It could be you. The network REALLY needs to know more about what part of the song its in. However, the \"hidden layer recurrence\" doesn't break down in this way. It subtely remembers everything it saw (with memories becoming more subtle as it they fade into the past).
