    "##  Kinds of AutoEncoders\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autoencoder (AE) based on a fully-connected layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used for data denoising and dimensionality reduction for data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# this is the size of our encoded representations\n",
    "encoding_dim = 32  # 32 floats -> compression of factor 24.5, assuming the input is 784 floats\n",
    "\n",
    "# this is our input placeholder\n",
    "input_img = Input(shape=(784,))\n",
    "# \"encoded\" is the encoded representation of the input\n",
    "encoded = Dense(encoding_dim, activation='relu')(input_img)\n",
    "# \"decoded\" is the lossy reconstruction of the input\n",
    "decoded = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)\n",
    "\n",
    "# this model maps an input to its reconstruction\n",
    "autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sparse AutoEncoder:\n",
    "Sparse autoencoders are a type of autoencoder with a sparsity enforcer that directs a single layer network to learn a code dictionary that minimizes reconstruction error while restricting the number of code-words required for reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, when we train an autoencoder, the hidden units in the middle layer would fire (activate) too frequently, for most training samples. We don’t want this characteristic. We want to lower their activation rate so that they only activate for a small fraction of the training examples. This constraint is also called the *sparsity constraint*. It is sparse because each unit only activates to a certain type of inputs, not all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used for feature extraction\n",
    "* Has more hidden Units than inputs.\n",
    "* This allows sparse representation of input data\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "encoding_dim = 32\n",
    "\n",
    "input_img = Input(shape=(784,))\n",
    "# add a Dense layer with a L1 activity regularizer\n",
    "encoded = Dense(encoding_dim, activation='relu',\n",
    "                activity_regularizer=regularizers.l1(10e-5))(input_img)\n",
    "decoded = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)\n",
    "\n",
    "autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep autoencoder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input_img = Input(shape=(784,))\n",
    "encoded = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_img)\n",
    "encoded = Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoded)\n",
    "encoded = Dense(32, activation='relu')(encoded)\n",
    "\n",
    "decoded = Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoded)\n",
    "decoded = Dense(128, activation='relu')(decoded)\n",
    "decoded = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(decoded)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional AutoEncoders (CAE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our inputs are images, it makes sense to use convolutional neural networks (convnets) as encoders and decoders.  \n",
    "In practical settings, autoencoders applied to images are always convolutional autoencoders --they simply perform much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input_img = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))  \n",
    "\n",
    "x = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(input_img)\n",
    "x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)\n",
    "x = Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)\n",
    "x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)\n",
    "x = Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)\n",
    "encoded = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# at this point the representation is (4, 4, 8) i.e. 128-dimensional\n",
    "\n",
    "x = Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(encoded)\n",
    "x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)\n",
    "x = Conv2D(8, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)\n",
    "x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)\n",
    "x = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)\n",
    "x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)\n",
    "decoded = Conv2D(1, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same')(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence-to-sequence autoencoder:\n",
    "If you inputs are sequences, rather than vectors or 2D images, then you may want to use as encoder and decoder a type of model that can capture temporal structure, such as a LSTM. To build a LSTM-based autoencoder, first use a LSTM encoder to turn your input sequences into a single vector that contains information about the entire sequence, then repeat this vector n times (where n is the number of timesteps in the output sequence), and run a LSTM decoder to turn this constant sequence into the target sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "inputs = Input(shape=(timesteps, input_dim))\n",
    "encoded = LSTM(latent_dim)(inputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "decoded = RepeatVector(timesteps)(encoded)\n",
    "decoded = LSTM(input_dim, return_sequences=True)(decoded)\n",
    "\n",
    "sequence_autoencoder = Model(inputs, decoded)\n",
    "encoder = Model(inputs, encoded)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variational AutoEncoder(VAE):\n",
    "Instead of letting your neural network learn an arbitrary function, you are learning the parameters of a probability distribution modeling your data.  \n",
    "If you sample points from this distribution, you can generate new input data samples: a VAE is a \"generative model\".  \n",
    "More precisely, it is an autoencoder that learns a [latent variable model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable_model) for its input data."
