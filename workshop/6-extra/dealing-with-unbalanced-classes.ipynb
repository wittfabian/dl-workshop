    "## Dealing with Unbalanced Classes in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real-world classification problems, we stumble upon training data with unbalanced classes. This means that the individual classes do not contain the same number of elements. For example, if we want to build an [image-based skin cancer detection system](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7639/full/nature21056.html#tables) using [convolutional neural networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/), we might encounter a dataset with about 95% negatives and 5% positives. This is for good reasons: Images associated with a negative diagnosis are way more common than images with a positive diagnosis. Rather than regarding this as a flaw in the dataset, we should leverage the additional information that we get. This blog post will show you how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unbalanced classes create two problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The accuracy (i.e. ratio of test samples for which we predicted the correct class) is no longer a good measure of the model performance. A model that just predicts “not cancer” everytime will yield a 95% accuracy, even though it is a bad (and even dangerous) model that does not yield any insight or scientific advancement, despite the fact that “95% accuracy” sounds like something good. In addition, it’s hard to get an intuition for how good a model with 96%, 97% or 98% accuracy really is.\n",
    "2. The training process might arrive at a local optimum that always predicts “not cancer”, making it hard to further improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, these problems are not so difficult to solve. Here are a few ways to tackle them."

    "### 1. Collect more data\n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, you could collect more data for the underrepresented classes to match the number of samples in the overrepresented classes. This is probably the most rewarding approach, but it is also the hardest and most time-consuming, if not downright impossible. In the cancer example, there is a good reason that we have way more non-cancer samples than cancer samples: These are easier to obtain, since there are more people in the world who haven’t developed cancer."

    "\n",

In the cancer example, we would almost have to double the size of the dataset in order to achieve a 50:50 share between the classes, which also doubles training time without adding any new information."

This has the positive side-effect of making the model more robust to unseen examples. However, it only does so for the underrepresented classes. Ideally, you would want to do this for all classes, but then the classes are unbalanced again and we’re back where we started."

I don’t recommend this solution."

    "A model that always predicts cancer will have a sensitivity of 1 and a specificity of 0. A model that never predicts cancer will have a sensitivity of 0 and a specificity of 1. An ideal model should have both a sensitivity of 1 and a specificity of 1. In reality, however, this is unlikely to be achievable. Therefore, we should look for a model that achieves a good tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity. So which one of the two is more important? This can’t be said in general. It highly depends on the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you build a photo-based skin cancer detection app, then a high sensitivity is probably more important than a high specificity, since you want to cause people who might have cancer to get themselves checked by a doctor. Specificity is a little less important here, but still, if you detect cancer too often, people might stop using your app since they unnecessarily get annoyed and scared.\n",

In order to incorporate the desired tradeoff into the training process, we need the samples of the different classes to have a different contribution to the loss. To achieve this, we can simply multiply the contribution of the cancer samples to the loss by"
