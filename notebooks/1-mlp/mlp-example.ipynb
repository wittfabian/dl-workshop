    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use the standard machine learning problem called the [iris flowers dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is well studied and is a good problem for practicing on neural networks because all of the 4 input variables are numeric and have the same scale in centimeters. Each instance describes the properties of an observed flower measurements and the output variable is specific iris species.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a multi-class classification problem, meaning that there are more than two classes to be predicted, in fact there are three flower species. This is an important type of problem on which to practice with neural networks because the three class values require specialized handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iris flower dataset is a well studied problem and as such we can expect to achieve a model accuracy in the range of 95% to 97%. This provides a good target to aim for when developing our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can [download the iris flowers dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data) from the UCI Machine Learning repository and place it in your current working directory with the filename iris.csv\n",

Because we used one-hot encoding for our iris dataset, the output layer must create 3 output values, one for each class. The output value with the largest value will be taken as the class predicted by the model.\n",
